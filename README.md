Air quality has been a major concern to our species for hundreds of
years, with our incremental use of natural resources for creation of
energy to power our ever growing need, we have pushed the natural
reservoir of our planet to its limits and in the process helped to increase
the release of harmful and detrimental gases into our atmosphere. 

Gases such as Carbon Monoxide, Sulphur dioxide, Carbon dioxide, Nitrogen
dioxide, and Ozone, which not only increase the overall temperature on
the earth surface but also act as harmful chemicals to the biosphere and
the life within it. It is important we develop ways to measure it.
To make this possible, the main approach should measure the most
polluting components of the vast array of pollutants and harm and affect
us. Our project focuses on the Particulate matter that is present in our
environments because PM is something that is much more stubborn and
creates greater health risk compared to every other component that is
capable of harming us, thus sensing and monitoring the PM
accumulation in a system gives a much better and clearer idea of the
demerits and harm of our approach to using resources and our lifestyle.

Through our photometric method of scaling and measuring the size and
the concentration of the PM in an environment we can find out the level
of pollution prevailing in that zone. The output of our set up gives
accurate reading of the size of the particulate matter (Between PM 2.5
and PM 10) and the concentration, and the entire device is controlled by
an Arduino Uno. The output can be analyzed and studied to get inference
about trends about the level and condition of the air quality in that
region and thus helps us to figure out how to change our methods to
better incorporate our processes which lead to greater generation of
Particulate Matter .

India lacks serious infrastructure that can accommodate our growing
industrialization and keep up with the ever increasing sources of
pollution. We are not developing steps and methods to combat the
amount of damage we are doing to our Flora and Fauna and it is
important we take matters in our own hands and create solutions that not
only save our livelihoods but also out lives and of those of the
generations that are going to come after us . We have pushed our planet
to its limits and we need technology that better our understanding and
perception so that we can make intelligent and informed decisions to fix
this growing threat.
